With this browser plugin you can choose whether to open particular web pages in
IE or bounce the navigation request to Chrome. It is meant to be a companion to
the Chrome Legacy Browser Support Extension to allow for seamless switching
between Chrome and IE.

The implementation is split into a core library used by all browser components,
a Chrome extension with a corresponding native plugin and an Internet Explorer
add-in to support the transition back to Chrome. Future extensions for further
browsers are possible including Firefox and Opera.
