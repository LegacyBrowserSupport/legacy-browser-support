Wildcards are not supported yet.\nURL prefix: Only proper URL prefixes are matched complete with protocol and port if needed. E.g. \"http://login.example.com\" or \"https://www.example.com:8080/login/\".\nNegative entry: Starts with \"!\" and continues as host-name part or URL prefix as described above. Negative entries are always opened in Chrome. E.g. \"!example.com\" or \"!file:///c:/localapp/\".\nWildcard entry: Contains only a single \"*\" character. Matches any URL. Intended to be used together with negative entries, if most URLs should be open in the alternative browser and only a small selection of URLs should be opened in Chrome.\n\nNegative entries have higher priorities than positive entries which allows for whitelisting of large portions of a domain while saving smaller sections to be opened in Chrome.\nThe wildcard entry if present is applied only after all other rules have been checked.\n\nThe following protocols are monitored for redirecting: http:, https:.\n\nIf not specified or left empty – no transition to the alternative browser will be triggered.",
