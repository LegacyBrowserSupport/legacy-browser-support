Intended to be used together with negative entries, if most URLs should be open in the alternative browser and only a small selection of URLs should be opened in Chrome.\n\nNegative entries have higher priorities than positive entries which allows to whitelist large portions of a domain while saving smaller sections to be opened in Chrome.\nThe wildcard entry if present is applied only after all other rules have been checked.\n\nThe following protocols are monitored for redirecting: http:, https:.\n\nIf not specified or left empty - no transition to the alternative browser will be triggered."
